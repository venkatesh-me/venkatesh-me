# Venkatesh - Professional Overthinker, Semi-Competent Coder 😎

**Full-time**: Hospital store assistant 🏥, (but I’d rather be coding)
—if only the job paid better and wasn’t so soul-sucking.  
**Part-time**: Learning **C**, **JS**, **HTML/CSS**, **Go**, **React**, **MongoDB**, and **regex**... Still figuring it out.

## Currently:

- Revisiting **JS**, **HTML**, **CSS** (again 😬), and diving deeper into **Go** and **C**.
- Probably spending way too much time on stuff that isn’t finishing projects. 🔄

## Plans:

- Making a **snake game** with a twist (abandoned for a while, here you control the food, not the snake) 🐍
- Trying to build an **e-commerce site** 💸 (spoiler: it may never happen)
- Learn **SQLite**, **Rust**, **OpenGL**, **Godot**, **Firebase**, **AWS**, and probably forget all the syntax 🤷‍♂️

## Other Fun Facts:

- I start projects, get distracted, and then wonder why I don’t finish them. If you like unfinished chaos, welcome to my world! 🌪️
